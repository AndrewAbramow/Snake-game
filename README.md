## Game Play

![Snake_gameplay](Snake_gameplay.png)

You (the player) control a virtual "snake" which roams around its little world eating food cones, food cylinders and trying to avoid its demise by running into itself or the edges of the world. With each food cylinder you (the "snake") eat, you grow larger, each food cone makes you faster; in turn making it increasingly difficult for you (the "snake") to continue your existance. When you manage to consume 10 food cylinders you will be promoted to the next level.

## Requirements

- C++ 17 compatitable compiler such as Clang or GCC
- Unreal editor 4.22.3
